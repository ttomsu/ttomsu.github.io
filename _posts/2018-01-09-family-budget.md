I've been interested in personal finance for about 10 years now - ever since my
first encounter with envelope budgeting back in senior year of college. It
continued through paying off tens of thousands of dollars in student loan debt,
to learning about 401(k)s and investing.

# Foundation
The foundation of my system comes from the website [You Need A Budget](https://ynab.com/referral/?ref=qIw1YzVljvsfBv_M&utm_source=customer_referral).
I first read the 4 founding principals back in 2007 when it was still a desktop
software product, but it fundamentally shaped my idea of how to handle money.

It involves 4 core principles:

1. Give Every Dollar A Job [https://www.youneedabudget.com/method/]
2. Embrace Your True Expenses [https://www.youneedabudget.com/method/rule-two/]
3. Roll With the Punches [https://www.youneedabudget.com/method/rule-three/]
4. Age Your Money [https://www.youneedabudget.com/method/rule-four/]

I'll go through the 4 rules here, but if you want a more in depth description, I
suggest checking out the founder Jesse Mechum's [book](https://www.amazon.com/You-Need-Budget-Paycheck-Paycheck-ebook/dp/B071Y2XSFN/ref=as_li_ss_tl?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1515465097&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=travistomsu-20&linkId=06dda7afdeba8339120b7c62b100aab2)
on all the ins and outs of the program.

# 1. Give Every Dollar a Job
It doesn't matter if you make $100/month or $10,000/month - each dollar you've
earned should get ear marked for how you're going to spend it. Some dollars will
go towards true needs, like rent or the utility bill. Some towards wants like
Netflix or that shiny new gadget. Finally, some dollars go toward servicing
debt, such as student loans or your monthly credit card bill.

This process of deciding how to allocate your dollars is considered conscious
spending, and I'm a big believer in it. By taking an honest look at what money
is coming in and what is leftover after your basic needs are taken care of can
we truly control your money  instead of letting it control you.

I generally take care of this at the very end of the month in preparation for
the next month. Specifically, I take all of the money earned in the past month
and use that as my baseline for the next month (more on that later).

# 2. Embrace your True Expenses
Numerous expenses don't fit into the nice monthly process, such as:

* Car insurance & maintenance
* Tax Return
* Travel/Vacations
* Christmas Gifts, etc.

These are very real expenses that pop up whether we'd like them to or not. But
they're not surprises, and because they're not surprises, it means we can plan
for them. For example, if you spent $1,200 on Christmas last year, then you
could put $100 in the "Gifts" bucket every month.

I have several of these "accumulating" buckets - all of the ones mentioned
above, in fact. The biggest one by dollar amount is my "Emergency Fund" bucket.
Dave Ramsey suggests growing this bucket up to $1,000 before focusing on things
like student loans. I agree with that approach, because it more easily allows
you to follow the next principle.

The other one I'd like to mention is my "Miscellaneous" bucket - it's basically
my "monthly overspend bucket." The YNAB software calls this bucket the "Things I
Forgot To Budget For." This bucket allows to me keep my "Emergency Fund" bucket
untouched except for true emergencies.

# 3. Roll With the Punches
The biggest thing to know about this process is that you will make mistakes, and
that's okay! I had a bit of a hard time with this one when I first started out.

Budgeting gets a bad rap because many people set up their budget how they think
they should  spend their money, not how they actually  spend it. So when the
true numbers come back a month later, they get discouraged and cognitive
dissonance sets it (the uncomfortable feeing you get when two competing ideas
are fighting in your head). It is much easier for the brain to give up on
budgeting altogether to avoid this discomfort.

Every single month for 10 years I've had to go back and fix my budget. 98.723%
of the time it's overspending in a few categories, and this is where my
"Miscellaneous" bucket comes in - I just move that money to the overspent
categories. I take note of why  I overspent in those categories, and sometimes
will adjust the budget upwards in the future.

For example, our "Dining Out" budget was constantly running over when we lived
in the NYC and ate out all the time. If you've ever seen the size of an NYC
apartment's kitchen, you probably wouldn't want to spend too much time there
either! I had set it absurdly low at $200/mo, and was constantly over spending
by $100-150/mo. That is, until I finally accepted in my head that $200 was
unrealistic, given our behavior. I increased the budget that month and every
month thereafter.

# 4. Age Your Money
I mentioned this one earlier - the core concept is that you spend money this
month that you earned last  month.

For example - my wife and I get paid every other week, so we have 2 paydays per
month. If those days are January 1 and 15, then the sum of those paydays because
my total budget for February.

The beauty of this system is that it works for any kind of payday schedule -
weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, and even freelance. The more irregular your
paycheck, the more important I think it is to know the ins and outs of your
cashflow.

The YNAB software actually calculates the age of your money for you, but I don't
find this metric all that helpful.

Our Buckets
Here is the list of our family's categories. We practice the "Yours, Mine, and
Ours" approach to shared finances, but I'll cover that in another post.

* Bills * Mortgage
  * Internet
  * Water
  * Electric
  * Gas

  * Insurance
  * Maintenance
  * Supplies
  * Furnishing
  * Lawn Care
  * Pets

This is just how our finances have shaken out. Yours will likely be somewhat
different, maybe even very different.
