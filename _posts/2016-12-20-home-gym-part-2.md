In [Part 1](/2016/12/15/home-gym-part-1.html), I showed
how I made the platform for my home gym. Today, I'll show you the assembly of
the second and key piece: the squat rack.

# Squat Rack
I chose the [Rogue Fitness HR-2 Half Rack](http://www.roguefitness.com/rogue-hr-2-half-rack)  as the epicenter for my gym
(shown here with the weight storage pegs). This setup the closest to what I have
at my gym in the city.

I've lifted at other gyms that have a full power cage and didn't like them
(pictured below). Strike one: the pin-and-pipe safety system is really
cumbersome to adjust. Strike two, and probably the biggest gripe: I'm tall
enough that when I overhead press, I whack the barbell against the top two
support beams. Strike three, it's nearly triple the price. You're out!

# Barbell
The next most important piece of the set up is the barbell. For most of my
lifting career, I've used a bare steel B&R bar, so that was my obvious choice.

Bare steel bars are known to be higher maintenance than chrome and zinc bars,
but it's the bar I've liked the most.

During the unboxing, I noticed a slight amount of oil on the bar. I believe this
is part of the maintenance process, because being bare steel after all, it is
prone to rust without proper care.

# Bumper Plates
Finally, the last piece of the puzzle are the plates. For those I choice [Fringe
Sport's colored bumper set](https://www.fringesport.com/collections/bumper-plates/products/ofw-color-bumper-plate-sets).

I went back and forth between these, a few Rogue sets, and the [Vulcan Alpha
bumper set](http://www.vulcanstrength.com/Vulcan-Alpha-Bumper-Plates-Set-p/alphbsets.htm).
I think the Vulcans look the coolest, but their long shipping time put them out
of the running. I went with Fringe because my lifting parter, Jack, highly
recommended their customer service, and I got exactly  the set I wanted:

 * 3 pairs of blue 45 lbs
 * 1 pair of green 25 lbs
 * 1 pair of gray 10 lbs

# All together
With more help from Keith (thanks again, Keith!), we had the full set together
in about 2 hours.

After about 3 weeks of no lifting, I finally got back in the groove this morning with some
overhead presses and power cleans.

<!-- ![](/content/images/2016/12/IMG_20161219_064746.jpg)Worked up to 125 on power
cleans for my first day back -->

It'll take some getting used to, but I really do
like all of my new equipment. I'll definitely be spending lots of time with this
stuff, and it's important to be happy with it.

# Future Enhancements
Here's a short list of things I still want to do with the space

 1. Install new LED light bars
 2. Install clock + resettable timer on the wall for time between sets.
 3. Computer station for easier music selection
 4. Live stream workouts
