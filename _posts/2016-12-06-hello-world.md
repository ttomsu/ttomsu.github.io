"Hello World" is always the first program you write when you're learning a new
programming language. It's supposed to get you familiar with the very basic
functionality of writing a program: printing some text.

I haven't manned a blog in many years - not since my college days when it was
more a public journal of weekend parties. Going back and rereading those posts
makes me cringe.

That doesn't mean there haven't been attempts to restart writing. I think many
times, though, I lacked a good (or any) reason to write.

I hope the only difference between this time and other times is now my
opportunity to write. You see, I recently made the move to suburbia, and with it
comes a 60 minute train ride. I plan to utilize that time to put my thoughts to
digital paper.

About what? I'm taking a hint from my from my blog title, "Everybody Needs a
Fishbowl," and imposing some limitations. I'll post to only the following
personal and professional categories:

 * Software design + patterns
 * Strength/Lifting numbers
 * New house
 * Personal Finances/Money
 * Self development

 Basically all of my personal and professional interests.

Stay tuned.
