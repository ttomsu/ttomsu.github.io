In the previous parts [1](/2016/12/15/home-gym-part-1.html) and [2](/2016/12/20/home-gym-part-2.html), I detailed
the design and equipment I used when my basement was unfinished.

There were a few flaws in my design:

1. **I used pressure-treated lumber as the base.** This wood is injected with chemicals to prevent rot when placed directly on the groud. It is *significantly* heavier than standard plywood, which at the time I thought was a good thing. After a while, the chemicals started to seep through the top-layer, causing ugly stains.
1. **I screwed and glued it all together.** At no point did I think I would ever need to _unscrew_ and _unglue_ it. If you read my [water leaks](/2019/12/18/water-leaks.html) post, you saw how a nearby window leaked after a heavy rain. I needed two neighbors to help me lift the platform only inches off the ground to let the water underneith dry out.

My wife and I decided to finish the basement this winter, which meant I needed to get everything out of the space. I spent an hour disassembling the rack, and another two hours dissecting the platform into manageable pieces. It did not go down without a fight.

The new space is a chance for a fresh start.

Ceiling height was a concern from the beginning, and became even more so after seeing the thick furring strips attached to the joists.

To compensate, I removed all supporting pieces from under the main platform. So instead of 5 total pieces of plywood, there was only 1.
